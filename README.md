This project focuses on the use of the convolutional neural network ResNet-50 for detecting lung diseases. Methods such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and other techniques to overcome overfitting were applied. The dataset used was the publicly available "NIH-Chest-X-ray-dataset" from Hugging Face. After training, the model was evaluated based on the AUC-ROC curve and sensitivity/specificity for each class individually.
